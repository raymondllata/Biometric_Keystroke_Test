# Biometric_Keystroke_Test

This is a Biometric Keystroke Test. The program uses tkinter as a GUI for a typing area. Person One will type for ~15 seconds at their normal typing speed. Person Two will type for ~15 seconds at their normal typing speed. After this, either Person One or Two will type for 15 seconds at their normal typing speed. This program will statistically model the key press timings to predict which person is currently typing. This program has limited short-term viability, but if installed and ran for a prolonged period of time, could be used as a security-esque program, recognizing whether or not the correct user is typing. 

Some ideas to be implemented:
 - Add functionality for sentence length not to depend on a timer, but on ENTER key press
 - Add reset button functionality
 - Clean up the UI
